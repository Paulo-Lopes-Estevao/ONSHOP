txt` to install the project modules

## Docker
  
- Run the `docker build --tag onshop .` or` docker command
build -t .`

### Codificação:

> Attention do not write, change or delete anything in the code from the main branch (default), for any new functionality you must create a new branch

- To create a new branch run the `git command
checkout -b <branch-name> `
    - To switch from one branch to another
existing in your local repository run `git
checkout <branch-name> `without` -b`

- After you have finished coding in the new
branch, send it to GitHub with the `git command
push -u origin <branch-name> `
    - After this step open a pull-request to
the main branch and wait for the Admin to analyze and make
the pull-request merge
